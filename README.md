# Solvector
Dependencies for this project: customtkinter, sqlite3, pygame, pywebview, numpy, sympy
This project was programmed for Python 3.10.X

To operate Solvector, all you have to do is download the file as a zip (By clicking the green button that says "<> Code", and then download as ZIP), extract it to a folder of your choice, and ensure that the correct dependencies are installed.
The main program is "master.py", and you can access the entirety of Solvector through that file. Solvector has a modular structure, so you can have as many or as few tabs open at any time. 
Follow the instructions in-app to navigate it. The app contains a:
 - Scientific Calculator
 - Graphing Calculator
 - Equation Solver
 - Inbuilt Notes Database 
 - User-created Resources Database, with a preloaded example
 - Web Viewer for notes and resources

Notes:
 - Database only goes up to 50 items for demonstrational purposes, you will find items in the earliest categories in the app, such as the defaults when you open the notes module.
 
Changelog:
 - Fixed zoom on previous graphs in graphing calculator
 - Added graph display/aesthetics
 - Implemented differentiation & other equation solving in solver
 - Implemented "delete" function for resources

Additional Information:
 - Techniques used with location: (mathematical models - solver/calculators), (Cross-parameterised SQL Database - Notes), (Webpage access and native display - Notes), (Stacks - Graphical Calculator function input), (Merge Sort - Notes search function), (OOP - Scientific Calculator), (GUI - throughout), (Text File organisation and access - Notes and Solver), (Advanced matrix operations - Solver simultaneous equations), etc.
