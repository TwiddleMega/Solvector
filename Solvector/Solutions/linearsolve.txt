f'''Input Equation:

{a}x+{b} = 0

To solve this linear equation, you first need to separate the knowns and unknowns.

Step 1: Take {b} to the other side to separate it from the variable, x.

{a}x = {-b}

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by {a} so that your variable is alone. This leaves you with a single constant on the right hand side, and a single variable on the left, and your equation is now solved!

x = {-b}/{a}
x = {solution}
