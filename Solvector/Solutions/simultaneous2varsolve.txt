f'''Input Equations:

{a}x{addsign(b)}y={c}
{d}x{addsign(e)}y={f}

The matrix corresponding to this simultaneous equation is {round(det,4)}, which means this matrix is non-singular, and can be solved.
Simultaneous equations can be solved through multiple methods. One such method is to rearrange your first equation in terms of a variable.

x = ({c}{addsign(-b)}y)/{a}

This value of x can then be substituted into your second equation. Once you simplify it, you will have a single variable linear equation. 
Once you solve for your value of y, substitute that value back into the rearranged equation above, and get the corresponding value of x. 
These values are your answer to the simultaneous equation. Be sure not to mix them up! 

The equation above has one solution:
 
x = {solx}
y = {soly}

This can also be demonstrated graphically. Rearrange your equations to make y the subject, and plot their lines. The point of intersection of the lines (x,y) is the solution to the simultaneous equation.
