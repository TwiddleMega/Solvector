f'''Input Equation:

{a}x^2+{b}x+{c} = 0

The equation can be factorised, since all terms have an x value in common. 
This leads to a simple solve, since the x can be factorised out of the function.

Step 1: Consider the quadratic equation {a}x^2 + {b}x = 0, and factorise out the x from the bracket:

x({a}x{addsign(b)}) = 0

Step 2: Both of these brackets must be equal to zero. So you can solve them both individually:
Once you do that, you get the following equation:

x=0
{a}x{addsign(b)}=0

This is now a simple linear equation that gives you your two values of x, shown below.

x=0, x={b}/{a}

or for a numerical answer:

x=0, x={solution}
