f'''Input Equations:

{a}x{addsign(b)}y{addsign(c)}z = {d}
{e}x{addsign(f)}y{addsign(g)}z = {h}
{i}x{addsign(j)}y{addsign(k)}z = {l}

The matrix corresponding to this simultaneous equation is {round(det,4)}, which means this matrix is non-singular, and has a solution that can be found.
This solution can be found through repetitive substitution. You can rearrange the first equation to make x the subject:

x = ({d}{addsign(-b)}y{addsign(-c)}z) / {a}

and substitute this into the other two equations. When you simplify, you will be left with two simultaneous equations in two variables. 
You can then solve this as you would, instructed in the "Simultaneous - 2 Var" section.

Once you find the values of y and z, they can be substituted back into the equation above for a final answer of x.
In this case, the solution to this equation is:

x = {round(solx,3)}
y = {round(soly,3)}
z = {round(solz,3)}
