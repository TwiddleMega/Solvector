The derivative of the above equation is displayed below:

{answer}


You can solve for the derivative by applying the rules below:


Power rule: If y = x^n, then dy/dx = nx^(n-1)

Product rule: If y = uv, then dy/dx = u*dv/dx + v*du/dx

Quotient rule: If y = u/v, then dy/dx = (vdu/dx - udv/dx) / v^2

Chain rule: If y = f(g(x)), then dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

Exponential function rule: If y = e^x, then dy/dx = e^x

Logarithmic function rule: If y = ln(x), then dy/dx = 1/x

Trigonometric function rule: If y = sin(x), then dy/dx = cos(x), and if y = cos(x), then dy/dx = -sin(x)

Some of these will be provided in the A-level formula booklet
