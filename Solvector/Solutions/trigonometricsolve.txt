f'''Input Equation:

{equation}

This equation can be solved using the trigonometric identities, and manipulating both sides to simplify the functions in the equation. These trigonometric identities are listed below:

sin(A±B) = sinAcosB ± cosAsinB

sin(A∓B) = cosAcosB ∓ sinAsinB

tan(A±B) = (tanA ± tanB) / (1 ∓ tanAtanB)

sin A + sinB = 2·sin(A+B/2)·cos(A-B/2)

sin A – sinB = 2·cos(A+B/2)·sin(A-B/2)

cosA + cosB = 2·cos(A+B/2)·cos(A-B/2)

cosA – cosB = 2·sin(A+B/2)·sin(A-B/2)

sin^2 + cos^2 = 1

tanA = sinA / cosA
