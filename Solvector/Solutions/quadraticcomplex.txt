f'''Input Equation:

{a}x^2+{b}x+{c} = 0

The determinant of this quadratic is under 0, which means it has no real roots. 
The determinant is given by b^2-4ac. In this case, that's {b}^2-4·{a}·{c}.
That's equal to {det}, which is negative.

How to solve a quadratic equation using the formula:

Step 1: Consider the quadratic equation {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c} = 0. Identify the values of a, b, and c (which you entered above)

Step 2: Insert the values into the quadratic formula:

x = -b+sqrt(b^2-4ac) / 2a, x = -b-sqrt(b^2-4ac) / 2a

x = {-b}+sqrt({b}^2-4x{a}x{c}) / 2x{a}, x = {-b}-sqrt({b}^2-4x{a}x{c}) / 2x{a}

Step 3: Now, factorise out the square root of -1, or i.

x = {-b}+sqrt({abs(det)})i / {2*a}
x = {-b}-sqrt({abs(det)})i / {2*a}

This can be left as an exact answer, and possibly simplified by dividing the numerator by the denominator to create two roots in the form "a+bi".
