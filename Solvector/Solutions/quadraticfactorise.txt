f'''Input Equation:

{a}x^2+{b}x+{c} = 0

The equation can be factorised, since the determinant is a square number. 
The determinant is given by b^2-4ac. In this case, that's {b}^2-4·{a}·{c}.
That's equal to {det}, which is a square number.

How to solve a quadratic equation through factorisation:

Step 1: Consider the quadratic equation {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c} = 0
Step 2: Now, find two numbers such that their product is equal to ac ({ac}) and sum equals to b ({b}).

(number 1)(number 2) = {a*c}
(number 1) + (number 2) = {b}

Step 3: Now, split the middle term using these two numbers,

{a}x^2 + (number 1)x + (number 2)x + {c} = 0

Step 4: Take the common factors out and simplify.

Once you do that, you get the following equation:

{factored}=0

Both of these brackets must be equal to zero. So you can solve them both individually:

({coeff2}x{addsign(str(int(sol1Numerator)))})=0
({coeff3}x{addsign(str(int(sol2Numerator)))})=0

This is now a simple linear equation that gives you your two values of x, shown below.

x={solution1}, x={solution2}'''
